## Battery Specs

<img src="/images/qtc/qtccharge.jpg" title="QuickTC Charging" alt="alt title"/>

The QuickTC has a rechargeable battery that allows all-day use and takes an hour to fully recharge. An LED next to the USB-C port will remain on while charging and turn off when the battery is fully charged. QuickTC can remain unused and off for up to a year before needing recharging.

The battery is lithium ion and the QuickTC is allowed in carry-on and checked baggage, per FAA Title 49 CFR 175.10(a)(18). Battery meets UN38.3 and IEC62133 standards and is UL Recognized according to UL1642.

#### Charging Voltage

QuickTC requires USB at 5V @ 2.5W, which is the lowest power USB you typically find. Any standard USB host such as a port on your laptop should be compatible. Charging will work at higher wattages, but must be powered by 5V maximum.

#### Compatible Cables

Both USB-C to USB-C and USB-A to USB-C cables are compatible with QuickTC.

Note: There will be no USB data connection to a USB Host as the QuickTC is power sink only.

### Battery Replacement

If the battery needs replacing please contact Factory Optic for directions.
