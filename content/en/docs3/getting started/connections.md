## Connect to QuickTC

The QuickTC is simple, use it at the end of your COAX to confirm timecode.

### BNC Input

The BNC input connects to your coax timecode feed, which should be a single-ended signal, per SMPTE ST 12-1:2014.

Input is standard 75 ohm BNC and has an input impedance of 10K ohm.

QuickTC will automatically turn on when it detects a possible LTC signal.

### USB-C Input

The USB-C connector is power input only. It is used for battery charging, and can also power the QuickTC for long-term use.
