## Connect to QuickTC

The QuickTC is simple, use it at the end of your COAX to confirm timecode.

### BNC Input

The BNC input connects to your coax timecode feed, which should be a single-ended signal, per SMPTE ST 12-1:2014.

Input is standard 75 ohm BNC and has an input impedance of 10K ohm.

QuickTC will automatically turn on when it detects a possible LTC signal.

### USB-C Input

The USB-C connector is power input only. It is used for battery charging, and can also power the QuickTC for long-term use.

QuickTC will turn ON when USB power is connected or disconnected.

#### USB-C to USB-C Cable

QuickTC works with any standard USB-C to USB-C cable, power-only or power + data.

#### USB-A to USB-C Cable

QuickTC works with any standard USB-A to USB-C cable that has power.

### USB Power Adapter or USB Host

Any standard USB Power Adapter or Host that can provide 5V @ 2.5W or higher should work.

QuickTC is USB-C compliant and will work with any USB-C compliant host or power adapter, including high power adapters.

Note: there will be no USB-C data connection to a USB Host.
