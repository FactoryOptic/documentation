## Preston MDR Compatability

All MDRs have one or two Serial connections.

These are currently the confirmed and tested versions compatible with SERVO32. If you need to upgrade, visit [Preston Cinema](https://prestoncinema.com/downloads/firmware)

Versions newer than shown here should be avoided until tested.

| MDR | Number of Serial Ports | Firmware Version |
| --- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| MDR-2 | 1 | Firmware v1.58 |
| MDR-3 | 2 | Firmware v1.144 |
| MDR-4 | 1 | Firmware v1.065 |

Note: Some MDR-3s (1st Gen, prior to mid 2019) will only connect to SERVO32 on one port. Be sure to try both ports.

## Lens Motor Compabibilty

Any lens motor that works with your MDR will work with SERVO32
