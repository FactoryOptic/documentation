## Preston MDR Firmware Compatibility

SERVO32 is currently compatible with the following firmware versions of the MDRs. If you need to upgrade firmware of the MDR, visit [Preston Cinema](https://prestoncinema.com/downloads/firmware). To use firmware versions newer than shown here, please contact Factory Optic.

| MDR   | Number of Serial Ports | Firmware Version |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| MDR-2 | 1                      | Firmware v1.58   |
| MDR-3 | 2                      | Firmware v1.144  |
| MDR-4 | 1                      | Firmware v1.065  |

Note: Some MDR-3s (1st Gen, prior to mid 2019) will only connect to SERVO32 on one port. Be sure to try both available ports.

## Preston MDR Serial Port Compatibility

Any MDR serial ports should work, although some of the older first-gen MDR-3s with two serial ports will only work on one of the ports. If the MDR-3 is not working on one port, be sure to try the other.

## Lens Motor Compatibility

Any lens motor that works with your MDR will work with SERVO32. In unmapped mode it is recommended that all motors be the same model number for the best accuracy. In mapped mode feel free to mix and match motors as you normally would.
