## Preston MDR Compatibility

SERVO32 is currently compatible with the following firmware versions of the MDRs. If you need to upgrade firmware of the MDR, visit [Preston Cinema](https://prestoncinema.com/downloads/firmware). To use firmware versions newer than shown here, please contact Factory Optic.

| MDR | Number of Serial Ports | Firmware Version |
| --- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| MDR-2 | 1 | Firmware v1.58 |
| MDR-3 | 2 | Firmware v1.144 |
| MDR-4 | 1 | Firmware v1.065 |

Note: Some MDR-3s (1st Gen, prior to mid 2019) will only connect to SERVO32 on one port. Be sure to try both available ports.

## Lens Motor Compatibility

Any lens motor that works with your MDR will work with SERVO32.
