## SD Card Issues

Makse sure SD card is inserted at boot up. It is not intended for the SD card to be removed during operation, so if it does get removed, be sure to reboot once it has been replaced.

## Problems with configuration

Delete the files on the SD card and install fresh from [github](https://github.com/FactoryOptic/syncrolinkSDCard)

## Network Issues

Syncro-Link can operate on any network, with our without a router. DHCP is supported, but STATIC is recommended.
